What's the story, like?
-----------------------

You're currently looking at my public dotfiles BZR repository. I use it to make
sure I (a) don't bugger up any of these files by making unintended or stupid
changes to them and (b) so that I can point people towards them for
inspiration/smugness. :-)


What's with the lack of dots?
-----------------------------

I like to keep the files and directories here visible, which means I drop the
initial dot from any of the files. Machines I use these files on have a
branch of this repo, and I symlink from the expected locations of the files
back to the local branch of this repo. See, simple!


I want to have my machine set up with your dotfiles, what would I need to do?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the directories and files are simple: just create symlinks back to
the copies in this repo, and you're sorted.

The 'config' directory is a little different, mind. In that case, you'll need
to link the individual files and directories in that into your '.config'
directory. Using the vim and zsh files, here's what you'll need to do:

    % mkdir ~/.config ~/repos
    % cd ~/repos
    % bzr branch http://projects.talideon.com/repos/dotfiles/
    % cd ~/.config
    % ln -s ../repos/dotfiles/config/zsh.d .
    % cd ..
    % for i in vim vimrc zprofile zshrc; do ln -s repos/dotfiles/$i .$i; done


Anything interesting here?
--------------------------

Not that I can think of. I guess zshrc and config/zsh.d/* are clever, but the
basic idea behind that isn't mine.
