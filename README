dotfiles

To install::

    make install

To uninstall::

    make uninstall

To reinstall::

    make reinstall

Simple!

Adding files
============

To add a file to a package, write something like this::

   stowage --add .config/i3/config --target ~ common

Here, I'm adding the file `.config/i3/config` in `~` to the `common` package.
The path provided to the `--add` flag must be relative to the path given by
the `--target` flag. It's moved into the specified package and then replaced
with a symlink.

Vim plugins
===========

I use vim-plug__, a fantastic plugin manager for Vim. See the instructions
there if you want instructions on how to use it.

============

I use fisher__ for managing fish plugins.

    make fetch-fisher

To fetch the plugins::

    fisher add evanlucas/fish-kubectl-completions

Notes
=====

I used to have a script called `findduplicates` here. I recommend either
fdupes_ or duff_ these days instead, if you happend to use it.
