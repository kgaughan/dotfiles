What's the story, like?
-----------------------

You're currently looking at my public dotfiles repository. I use it to make
sure I (a) don't bugger up any of these files by making unintended or stupid
changes to them and (b) so that I can point people towards them for
inspiration/smugness. :-)


What's with the lack of dots?
-----------------------------

I like to keep the files and directories here visible, which means I drop the
initial dot from any of the files. Machines I use these files on have a branch
of this repo, and I symlink from the expected locations of the files back to
the local branch of this repo. See, simple!


I want to have my machine set up with your dotfiles, what would I need to do?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the directories and files are simple: just create symlinks back to the
copies in this repo, and you're sorted.

The 'config' directory is a little different, mind. In that case, you'll need
to link the individual files and directories in that into your '.config'
directory. Using the vim and zsh files, here's what you'll need to do::

    % mkdir ~/.config ~/repos
    % cd ~/repos
    % git clone git@github.com:kgaughan/dotfiles.git
    % cd ~/.config
    % ln -s ../repos/dotfiles/config/zsh.d .
    % cd ..
    % for i in vim vimrc zprofile zshrc; do ln -s repos/dotfiles/$i .$i; done


Anything interesting here?
--------------------------

Little that I can think of. I guess zshrc and config/zsh.d/* are clever, but
the basic idea behind that isn't mine.

There's some cleverness in zprofile to set up PATH appropriately so that only
paths that haven't already been added to PATH are added and all the paths
exist.

Another thing I do is that I don't like having a ~/bin directory and instead
put everything like that under .local, which I use as a user-specific version
of /usr/local.


Anything you're planning to change?
-----------------------------------

Move ~/.gpg-agent-info to ~/.cache/gpg-agent-info - anything that doesn't need
to be in ~ should be in one of ~/.config, ~/.cache, or ~/.local as far as I'm
concerned. ~/.zshrc may end up moving to ~/.config/zshrc if possible, leaving
only ~/.zprofile, which would leave me happy. I'd also like to add some kind of
autoconfiguration script.


Vim plugins
-----------

I now use vim-plug__ as my Vim plugin manager, so there's no submodule
jiggery-pokery to worry about anymore.

.. __: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

To install plugins within Vim: run::

     :PlugInstall

To update installed plugins, run:

    :PlugUpdate
